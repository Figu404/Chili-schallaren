# Requirements

As the plant beholder, I want to know the humidity of the soil so I know when I need to water it

As the user, I want to have the plant watered when the humidity is too low, so I don't need to do it

As a user, I want to know when the plant is watered or when the humidity is too low, so I know what is happening

As the plant owner, I want the heat lamp to turn off if the water has run out, so that the plant does not die of dehydration
