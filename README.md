## Abstract

This is a project for the course "Introductory project". Our project is about a plant watering system. The plant will be watered if needed, and a heat lamp that will turn of and on automaticlly as needed.

## Bakground and idea

We're making a product that monitors the humidity level of the soil and sends a warning message when it gets too low. The idea comes from the over watering of plants all over the world and forgetful students who can't remember to water their plants. We do this to make sure that the right amount of water is used for the plants so the plant does not die.

## Method
To control the project we’re using a [Lopy4-Microcontroller](https://pycom.io/product/lopy4/) and a [Expantionboard v3.1](https://pycom.io/product/expansion-board-3-0/). To the microcontroller there are two [relays][1] and a [soil moisture sensor](https://www.electrokit.com/uploads/productfile/41015/41015738_-_Soil_Moisture_Sensor.pdf). The Relay
